# Configuration

##Â Basic
This is a quick example about how to configure the application with Alexa as media player and 2 window/door sensors.

```yaml
home_alarm:
  module: home_alarm
  class: HomeAlarm
  sensors:
    - binary_sensor.livingroom_window_contact
    - binary_sensor.entrance_door_contact
  safe_mode: input_boolean.safe_mode
  sound: amzn_sfx_scifi_alarm_04
  media_player: media_player.alexa
  notifiers:
    - notify.mobile_app_iphone
    - notify.notifier
```

## Advanced
Example of an advanced configuration. I recommend to take a look `Attributes` section.

```yaml
home_alarm:
  module: home_alarm
  class: HomeAlarm
  sensors:
    - binary_sensor.livingroom_window_contact
    - binary_sensor.entrance_door_contact
  safe_mode: input_boolean.safe_mode
  activation_delay: 10
  media_player: media_player.alexa
  sound: amzn_sfx_scifi_alarm_04
  loop_delay: 4
  stop_delay: 240
  notifiers:
    - notify.mobile_app_iphone
    - notify.notifier
  alert_title: "ALARM ALERT!"
  alert_msg: "Alarm has been fired"
```

ðŸ’¡ ** IMPORTANT NOTE **

`sound` and `loop_delay` are linked variables. If the track specified at `sound` is too short, you will want to repeat it continuously specifying the attribute `loop_delay` as the same as the `sound` track duration.
